# Architecture

## Frontend

React: I would recommend using React as the frontend JavaScript library for building the user interface of the application. React is a popular choice for building web applications because it allows for the creation of reusable UI components and efficient rendering of updates to the UI.

Redux: I would recommend using Redux in conjunction with React to manage the application's state. Redux is a state management library that allows for the centralization of application state and makes it easy to track changes to state over time. This can be particularly useful in a booking system, where the state of the application may change frequently as users create, update, and delete appointments.

## Backend

Node.js: I would recommend using Node.js as the backend runtime environment for the application. Node.js is a popular choice for building server-side applications because it allows for the creation of scalable network applications using JavaScript.

Express: I would recommend using the Express library to build the backend API for the application. Express is a popular choice for building APIs in Node.js because it provides a simple and flexible way to define routes and handle HTTP requests.

MongoDB: I would recommend using MongoDB as the database for storing application data. MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database that is well-suited for storing large amounts of data in a flexible, JSON-like format.

## Codebase structure

I would recommend organizing the codebase into separate directories for the frontend and backend, with the frontend code in a "client" directory and the backend code in a "server" directory. Within each of these directories, I would further divide the code into subdirectories based on the type of functionality (e.g. "components" for frontend components, "routes" for backend routes, etc.).
Routing:

For the frontend, I would recommend using the React Router library to handle routing between different pages of the application. This would allow users to navigate to different pages of the application by clicking on links or by entering URLs into the browser.

For the backend, I would recommend using the Express router to handle routing for the API. This would allow clients to send HTTP requests to the appropriate routes in order to perform actions such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting appointments.

## Data storage

As mentioned above, I would recommend using MongoDB to store application data. This would allow the application to store data in a flexible, JSON-like format, and would allow for easy querying and updating of data using the MongoDB query language.

## Other functionalities

In addition to the functionality that you've described, there may be other functionalities that are necessary for a complete booking system. For example, you may want to implement email notifications to alert users of upcoming appointments, or you may want to implement payment processing to allow users to pay for appointments online. These additional functionalities could be implemented using libraries or services such as the Node.js "nodemailer" library for sending emails or a payment processing service such as Stripe.
